# Stock-Tracker
Shows you how much money you've gained per stock, per cryptocurrency, or both!


Before you run this open up a terminal and copy/paste the following:
pip install yfinance
pip install coinmarketcap


How to configure this tool:
If you wish to track stocks, edit my_stocks.txt
If you wish to track cryptocurrency, edit my_crypto.txt
Both will be configured into your total gains/losses if you have values in both files

How to run this tool:
Open up a terminal and type 'python3 track.py' and that's it!
